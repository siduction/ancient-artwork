READ THIS CAREFULLY!

1. Install lightdm-kde-greeter, apt-get install lightdm-kde-greeter.

2. Copy the "<theme>" folder to /usr/share/kde4/apps/lightdm-kde-greeter/themes/ (cp <theme> /usr/.....)

3. Copy  the lightdm-kde-greeter.conf, you find it in conf-<theme>/ to /etc/lightdm/

Don't forget to backup the orginal /etc/lightdm/lightdm-kde-greeter.conf, like
mv /etc/lightdm/lightdm-kde-greeter.conf /etc/lightdm/lightdm-kde-greeter.conf.orig!!!!!!

4. Open the kde-systemsettings and choose the lightdm-theme Siduction-indiansummer
 
5. For to test it befor using it you can run  the following command,
do it as $user: dm-tool add-nested-seat or: /usr/sbin/lightdm --test-mode
(you need xserver-xephyr installed), this works fine with all lightdm versions.

If all working fine, enjoy it.

Ps.: If you want that lightdm speak your language, you need to generate a foo.mo file and copy the foo.mo file to its right place!

Sorry, in the moment there is only the german part for "laikas-rache" (laikas-revenge) translated.
If you need the translation part for your country, feel free to it.
I will do that work maybe in some days, maybe ;) For shure i will do!

Go to po/<country>/ like 'cd /foo/bar/lightdm-kde-greeter/po/<country>/' 

(you need to have getext installed, apt-get install getext)

msgfmt lightdm_theme_<theme>.po -o lightdm_theme_<theme>.mo

in your <country> dir

then as #root, 

copy the lightdm_theme_<theme>.mo file to /usr/share/locale/<country>/LC_MESSAGES with

cp lightdm_theme_<theme>.mo `kde4-config --prefix`/share/locale/<country>/LC_MESSAGES

do it with both files in po/<country>/*

Test it like described above.
